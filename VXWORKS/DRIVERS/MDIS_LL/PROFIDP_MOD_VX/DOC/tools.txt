Description:
   Test tool for the PROFIDP driver.   
   This program must be used in cyclic data transfer mode.   
   I.e. descriptor key CYCLC_DATA_TRANSFER must be TRUE.   
   
   The program initializes the profibus with the configuration    
   data that is read from a file.   
   
   When nothing is entered by the user, this program displays   
   the current slave's diagnostic status and input data   
   periodically.   
   
   The user can however enter the following commands:   
   h: display this help   
   s: change current slave   
   w: modify slave outputs   
   e: exit   
   
   Any bus events (FM2) are displayed as well.
